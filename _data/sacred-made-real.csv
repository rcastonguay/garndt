Blue paint under the pinkish flesh tones suggests the bruising of Christ's skin. The rivulets of blood that trickle down his body are soaked up by the loincloth around his waist. Mena inserted glass eyes into the sockets and used real hair for the eyelashes. The sculpture was made for the illegitimate son of Philip IV, Don Juan of Austria, for his private devotion. The brutal realism would have reminded him that contemplation of suffering was a pathway to true faith and understanding.
